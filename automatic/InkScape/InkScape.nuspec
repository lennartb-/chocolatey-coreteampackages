Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor similar to Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Freehand, or Xara X. What sets Inkscape apart is its use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an open XML-based W3C standard, as the native format.

Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha blending, etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined interface. It is very easy to edit nodes, perform complex path operations, trace bitmaps and much more. We also aim to maintain a thriving user and developer community by using open, community-oriented development.

All Inkscape projects may be exported in formats friendly to web browsers or commercial printer rooms. It is cross-platform, which means it is easy to run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux distributions. Visit the Download page to install or share this application now. 

## Features

- Object creation: drawing, shape tools, text tool, bitmaps, clones
- Object manipulation: transformations, z-order operations, grouping, layers, aligment
- Fill and stroke: color selector, color picker tool, copy/paste style, pattern fills, dashed strokes, with many predefined dash patterns, path markers (ending, middle and/or beginning marks, e.g. arrowheads)
- Operations on paths
- Rendering: fully anti-aliased display, alpha transparency support for display and PNG export
- File formats: SVG, PNG, OpenDocument Drawing, DXF, sk1, PDF, EPS and PostScript export formats and more
- Command line options for export and conversions
